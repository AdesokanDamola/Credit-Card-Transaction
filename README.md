Delaware’s State Employee Credit Card Transactions Analysis.
I've crafted a Power BI dashboard using random financial data related to Delaware’s State Employee Credit Card transactions. The aim is to highlight my prowess in Power BI.
The dashboard delves into credit card transactions spanning 7 years. It has three pages seamlessly connected using bookmarks. 
The first page is a summary of the whole analysis, while the other two pages filter the dashboard by year. Clicking a button will effortlessly switch between pages.
I enhanced the user experience with a slicer on the summary page to dynamically filter data by year also.
